# Calli Herrmann's Portfolio

Welcome to my professional portfolio on GitHub! Here you'll find a showcase of my projects, skills, and accomplishments in the field of software development. I used React, Typescript, and TailwindCSS for this portfolio.

## About Me

After graduating from the Turing School of Software and Design and UNC Greensboro, I transitioned from a passion for environmental studies to becoming a dedicated software engineer. At my most recent role as the core frontend developer at Astral Insights, I honed my skills in React Native, working hands-on to deliver high-quality code and seamless tech solutions. My experience with Scrum methodology and task management using Jira has strengthened my ability to thrive in collaborative, fast-paced environments.

In addition to my technical expertise, I bring a unique perspective with a minor in American Sign Language, reflecting my commitment to inclusivity and communication. My goal is to leverage technology to enhance accessibility, equity, and positive community impact. Iâ€™m eager to continue growing and contributing to a team focused on creating innovative solutions that address real-world challenges.
